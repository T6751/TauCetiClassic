/*
Asset cache quick users guide:
Make a datum at the bottom of this file with your assets for your thing.
The simple subsystem will most like be of use for most cases.
Then call get_asset_datum() with the type of the datum you created and store the return
Then call .send(client) on that stored return value.
You can set verify to TRUE if you want send() to sleep until the client has the assets.
